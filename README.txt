To use this project you first need to download the waitress hosting service through python.
You can do this using the pip command with waitress.

I would suggest running this project through pycharm as you can add waitress to its virtual enviroment and run it there.
There is an example database in the instance folder that you can alter with your own creditentals and cash amount.

Run the program in your preferred format and navigate to the website URL. Join the only room available and play a game.
